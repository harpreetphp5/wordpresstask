I have created a plugin to load the Request a quote form which is created using react.js

When you submit the form it saves the information in Posts(Title="Company Name", Decription="Phone Number")

I have also created another plugin to create a custom block for the footer.

I have put json in a function and created shortcodes for rest of the sections and loaded the data from hardcoded json.
